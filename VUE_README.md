# Vue.js Multi-Language E-commerce Store Challenge

## Objective

Your task is to create a simple multi-language e-commerce store using Vue.js. This challenge aims to test your understanding of Vue.js, Vue store management, components, and localization for Arabic and English languages. You will also need to demonstrate your knowledge of Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Requirements

The application should incorporate the following features:

1. **Multi-Language Support (Arabic/English):** The application should support both Arabic and English languages. Users should be able to switch between languages. This should not only change the language of the content but also the layout (LTR for English, RTL for Arabic).

2. **Product List:** Display a list of products with basic details like image, name, and price.

3. **Product Details:** On clicking a product, show more detailed information about the product.

4. **Cart:** Users should be able to add products to a shopping cart and view the cart.

5. **Vue Store:** All data should be managed using the Vue Store.

6. **Responsive Design:** The application should be responsive and mobile-friendly using Bootstrap.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Vue Project:** Setup your Vue.js application using Vue CLI. Remember to also setup Vue Router for navigation and Vuex for state management.

2. **Creating Components:** Create necessary components such as `ProductList`, `ProductDetail`, `Cart`, `Navbar`, etc.

3. **Manage Data with Vuex:** Create necessary Vuex actions, mutations, and state to manage your products and cart.

4. **Localization:** Implement multi-language support for both Arabic and English. All static text should be placed in localization files and loaded depending on the selected language. Remember to handle RTL layout when Arabic is selected.

5. **Implement Bootstrap:** Use Bootstrap to create a responsive design. You can use Bootstrap-Vue if you prefer.

6. **APIs (Optional):** If you're comfortable, create a mock API using tools like json-server and use it to fetch product data.

## Submission

Please submit a link to a Git repository containing your code. The repository should include all necessary code files, as well as a README file that includes the following:

1. Setup and run instructions.
2. Any assumptions or simplifications you have made.
3. A brief description of how you have structured your Vue.js application and why.
4. Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

You have 4 days to submit the completed project.

Good luck!
